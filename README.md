## The Goal of This Website
The idea behind Picturesque project was building an e-commerce web application targeting my personal photos that will feature the ability to filter based on desired photography category, a live functional payment system, a complete authentication ecosystem that includes email confirmation and user profile, finally real time notifications to complete our user's experience.

The web application is carved into the following sections:
- Home page. It presents what the website has to offer by inviting the user to explore the photo collections 
- Login/Registration page. Allow users to sign in or sign up. 
- Store page. It gives our users the possibilty to filer based on price, rating, category or simply explore all photos.
- Gallery page. It is more focused on the artwork side by offering the ability to only choose for viewing specific photography topic with the business element in mind to quickly sort based on price low to high or high to low, rating, name or category.
- Photo Detail page. After clicking/choosing a photo the user lands on a page focused on that particular photography where there is a title, price, category, rating, description, a quantity adjustment mechanism, possilibity to add the photo to the photobag for future purchase and of course a botton to go back and explore other pics that will hopefully share the same fate. 
- Photo Bag page. Here the user can see a summary of the photos he/her is willing to purchase and can further adjust the quantity, see the total sum in euro for the photos, delivery cost involved and this can be 0 if a certain threshold is met, the secure checkout button that will send the user to the final step before he/her can enjoy the purchased bits of art.
- Checkout page. Here is the checkout form that needs to be filled with the user details regarding identification, delivery address and payment card info. The user can also get in touch with the order details emphasizing the items in the photobag that are about to be purchased.
- Profile page.
- Picturesque Management page.
